#this is a discussion revolving around cfa lvl 1 to help me practice. if i can show someone how it is done, then that means i know it well enough.

I am currently practicing financial statement analysis. i am way behind. 
in the analysis of inventories, one of the recurring subjects i see is the fact that USA GAAP does not allow for reversals of write-downs. i am sure this will come up in some form in the exam.
