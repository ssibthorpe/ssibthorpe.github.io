  <h1>Why Law 25 Compliance Shouldn't Cost $10,000</h1>

  <p>
    If you're running a startup or small business in Quebec, you've likely heard of Law 25. It’s Quebec’s new data privacy law—our version of GDPR. And if you collect, store, or use personal information from clients, customers, or employees, you’re expected to comply.
  </p>

  <p>
    But here’s the problem: most early-stage teams don’t have the time or budget to bring in a legal team. Law firms charge thousands for compliance packages, and many off-the-shelf software tools are overkill for what most small orgs actually need.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why I’m building a Law 25 Compliance Kit.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s designed specifically for Quebec startups and SMEs—lean teams that need to get compliant fast, without unnecessary complexity. The kit includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A bilingual privacy policy you can adapt to your website and operations</li>
    <li>A plug-and-play Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) template</li>
    <li>A consent management checklist</li>
    <li>Internal documentation to satisfy your obligations under the law</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It’s not legal advice—but it’s everything you actually need to check the box and reduce your risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compliance shouldn't slow you down. If you’re interested in testing the kit or want a preview,
