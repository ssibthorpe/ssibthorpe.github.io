Self employement and independence 

I dont know what it is about having your own job, but the idea of independence and freedom, and creating something that is my own is intoxicating. At my job, I have learned so much, and have progressed as a person and worker tremendously. However, I like the idea of making my own money much more.

I am in search of a way I can contribute to the community and economy, and help people locally. 

I want to create and build things, invest in the fabric that makes my city what it is. This project is my cry for making a difference in the world. I want my voice to be heard. That is my selfish desire.
