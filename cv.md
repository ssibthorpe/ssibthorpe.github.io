  <h1>Why You Should Trust Me</h1>

  <p>
    I'm Sebastien Sibthorpe. I specialize in audit and compliance, with hands-on experience helping small and medium organizations in Quebec navigate risk, regulation, and operational controls.
  </p>

  <p>
    I built this Law 25 Compliance Kit because I’ve seen how unclear, expensive, and over-complicated compliance has become—especially for startups and SMEs that can’t afford a law firm or consulting package.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to give you a practical, no-BS, bilingual toolkit that helps you check the Law 25 box and get back to building.
