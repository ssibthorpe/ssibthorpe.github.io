Hello all! My name is Sebastien, and I hold a bachelors degree in finance. I am currently working in risk advisory at BDO. Living in montreal, I get to experience a great work life balance, little housing issues, and loving parks and nature. By night, I explore the intersections of finance, economics, and inequality, breaking down complex topics into practical insights.

I'm writing this blog to help inform canadians on pertinent news that will directly affect them, wether they realize it or not. I will analyze key economic trends, discuss financial solutions, and challenge conventional thinking on wealth distribution and policy. Whether you're a professional, a student, or just curious about how money shapes our world, I hope youâ€™ll find something here to spark new ideas.

**Causes I champion:**
- Increased equality
- Reduced zoning laws to improve dencity
- Financial literacy.

**Issues I plan on exploring**
- Housing affordability
- Banking & Credit Inequality
- Corporate Accountability & Ethical Investing
- Universal Basic Income (UBI) & Social Safety Nets
- Tax Fairness & Loopholes
