Hello all! My name is Sebastien, Living in montreal, I get to experience a great work life balance, little housing issues, and loving parks and nature. outside of my job, I explore the intersections of finance, economics, personal projects, and with a goal of breaking down complex topics into practical insights.

I'm writing this blog to explore ideas I find fascinating, and that will help people out, wether it makes a small or large impact. 

**Issues I plan on exploring**
- Housing affordability
- Banking & Credit Inequality
- Corporate Accountability & Ethical Investing
- Tax Fairness & Loopholes


** projects I find interesting**
- Keyboards
- Programming
- Computers
- Drones
- Hands on creation and physical projects
